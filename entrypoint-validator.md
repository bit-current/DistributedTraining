 # HiveTrain Validator Script

This script is designed to execute the `validator.py` file from the `hivetrain` directory using Python 3 and its associated dependencies. The script sets the interpreter as `/bin/bash`.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Start the execution of validator.py with Python 3
python3 hivetrain/validator.py \
```

## Prerequisites

- A working Python environment (Python 3 or later) should be installed and configured on your system.
- The HiveTrain project, which includes the `validator.py` file, should be present in the specified directory `hivetrain`.

## Usage

1. Make sure you have all required packages for running the script.
2. Save the script in a `.sh` file with an appropriate name, e.g., `run_validator.sh`.
3. Grant execution permissions to the script using the command: `chmod +x run_validator.sh`
4. Run the script using: `./run_validator.sh`

## Configuration

The script does not include any specific configuration options, but you can modify the arguments passed to the `validator.py` script in the following line:

```bash
python3 hivetrain/validator.py \
    --port 4000
```

Replace the value of `--port 4000` with your desired configuration option, if needed. For more information about available options, consult the `validator.py` documentation or use the command `python3 hivetrain/validator.py -h`.
