 # Subnet Configuration Logic

This documentation describes the logic behind a Python script that imports modules from various files to configure subnets.

## Dependencies

The following Python code relies on three imported modules: `base_subnet_config`, `config`, and `hivetrain_config`. These modules provide different functionalities necessary for the subnet configuration logic.

```python
from .base_subnet_config import *  # Importing functions and variables from base_subnet_config
from .config import check_config, Configurator  # Importing check_config function and Configurator class from config module
from .hivetrain_config import *  # Importing functions and variables from hivetrain_config
```

## Base Subnet Configuration

The `base_subnet_config` module is the foundation for our subnet configuration logic. It contains various configurations, such as CIDR blocks, IP ranges, and other constants needed to configure subnets. By importing all functions and variables from this module, we can access these configurations throughout our script.

## Config Validation and Classes

The `config` module is responsible for checking the validity of configuration files using the `check_config` function. It also provides a custom `Configurator` class to simplify the process of managing and applying configs. The `Configurator` class may include methods or properties that help our script interact with these configurations.

## HiTrain Configuration

The `hivetrain_config` module likely contains configurations specific to a HiTrain project, such as network settings for various components within the system. By importing all functions and variables from this module, we can access those configurations when configuring subnets for the HiTrain project.

## Combining Logic

The exact usage of these imported modules depends on the implementation details of your specific Python script. The logic behind the subnet configuration process would likely involve validating the provided configuration files, importing required configurations from various modules, and applying these configurations to create or update subnets accordingly.
