 # Documentation for `remove_nest_asyncio_import.py`

This script is designed to remove an import statement of `nest_asyncio` in the `bittensor` package's `__init__.py` file and uninstall the `nest_asyncio` package.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3
- `pip` installed
- `bittensor` package installed

## Functionality

The script begins by importing necessary modules:

```python
import os
import pkg_resources
```

The main function is `remove_nest_asyncio_import()`, which contains the following logic:

1. Attempts to locate the installation directory of `bittensor`.
2. Finds the path to `bittensor/__init__.py`.
3. Checks if the file exists and reads its contents into a list of lines.
4. Removes all instances of lines containing 'nest_asyncio' import statement from the list of lines.
5. Writes back the modified lines into the `bittensor/__init__.py` file.
6. Uninstalls the `nest_asyncio` package using pip.

The script includes error handling for cases when:
- The `bittensor` package is not installed.
- The `bittensor/__init__.py` file does not exist.

## Usage

To use this script, simply run it in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
python remove_nest_asyncio_import.py
```

If the prerequisites are met, and the script successfully executes, it will have removed the `nest_asyncio` import statement from the `bittensor/__init__.py` file and uninstalled the `nest_asyncio` package.
