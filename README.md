# Exploring New Frontiers : א・hivemind・25

## Essential Guide for Bittensor Enthusiasts:
Beginners to Bittensor are encouraged to start with the basics by visiting the [Bittensor official site](https://www.bittensor.com). This foundational step is crucial for understanding the innovative landscape Bittensor is shaping.

## Launching Subnet Hivemind-25: Our Quest:
Our ambition is to train the largest ever Large Language Model (LLM), harnessing the unique strengths of the Bittensor network's and in a completely decentralised manner. Our approach is rooted in transparency and open collaboration in the AI space. 
## The Significance of Our Endeavor:
An overview of the "LMSYS Chatbot Arena Leaderboard" highlights the predominance of proprietary models. Our endeavor seeks to challenge this norm, ushering in a new phase of open and inclusive AI development practices.

## What we’ve done 
After a period of intense experimentation and evaluation, we have successfully trained our inaugural model (tinygpt2), marking the first ever incentivized distributed training over the internet (incentivized with TAO). 

We are currently in our next project phase  (training a slightly larger GPT2 model - 677m params), and we invite you to join our mission by dedicating your computational resources towards this training run. All you have to do is run a miner, and it may just change the world.

## Live Status 
* Done : Train TINYGPT  
* In Progress : GPT2 Training Run - 667m Params
* Roadmap (Dropping 16 Feb 2024)
* Office Hours (Timing TBC - Dropping 16 Feb 2024)
* Step-by-Step Guide to Mining on Hivemind (Dropping 16 Feb 2024)

## Known Issues (fix in progress)
* load_state_from_peers errors
* ⁠All_reduce errors
* Timeout errors
* suddenly diminishing miner incentive

## New Bounties
* Improving our validation mechanism is key, take a look at it and make a propposal (@bitcurrent on discord) - if accepted you can execute. 5t reward upon exection. Please propose before execution!

## Frequently Asked Questions
* What are the minimum requirements to run a validator? A GPU with a minimum of 16GB RAM e.g. RTX A4000
* What are the minimum requirements to run a miner? A GPU with a minimum of 16GB RAM e.g. RTX A4000

Once you have installed this repo you can run the miner and validator with **auto updates enabled** using the following commands.
```bash
# To run the miner
chmod +x run_miner.sh
pm2 start run_miner.sh --name distributed_training_miner_auto_update -- \
    --netuid 25 \
    --subtensor.chain_endpoint <your chain url> \  # Must be attained by following the instructions in the docs/running_on_*.md files
    --wallet.name <your miner wallet> \ # Must be created using the bittensor-cli
    --wallet.hotkey <your validator hotkey> \ # Must be created using the bittensor-cli
    --logging.debug \ # Run in debug mode, alternatively --logging.trace for trace mode
    --axon.port <an open port to serve the bt axon on> \
    --dht.port <another open port to serve the dht axon on> \
    --dht.announce_ip <your device ip address>

# To run the validator
chmod +x run_validator.sh
pm2 start run_validator.sh --name distributed_training_auto_update -- \
    --netuid 25 \
    --subtensor.chain_endpoint <your chain url> \ # Must be attained by following the instructions in the docs/running_on_*.md files
    --wallet.name <your validator wallet> \  # Must be created using the bittensor-cli
    --wallet.hotkey <your validator hotkey> \ # Must be created using the bittensor-cli
    --logging.debug \ # Run in debug mode, alternatively --logging.trace for trace mode
    --axon.port <an open port to serve the bt axon on> \
    --dht.port <another open port to serve the dht axon on> \
    --dht.announce_ip <your device ip address>
```
