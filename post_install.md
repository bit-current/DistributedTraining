 # Documentation for `remove_nest_asyncio_import.py`

This Python script, named `remove_nest_asyncio_import.py`, is designed to remove an import statement of a specific package (`nest_asyncio`) from the `__init__.py` file of another package called `bittensor`. Additionally, it uninstalls the `nest_asyncio` package if found in the system.

## Dependencies

To run this script, you need to have Python and the following packages installed:
- `os` (Python built-in library)
- `pkg_resources` (installed via pip)

## Functionality

The main function of the script is defined as `remove_nest_asyncio_import()`. It contains logic for locating the `bittensor` package, checking if its `__init__.py` file exists, removing any import statements related to `nest_asyncio`, and uninstalling the `nest_asciio` package if it is installed.

### Locate the installation directory of bittensor

```python
distribution = pkg_resources.get_distribution('bittensor')
bittensor_path = distribution.location
```

This code uses `pkg_resources` to get information about the installed `bittensor` package and retrieves its installation directory.

### Check for existence of bittensor __init__.py

```python
if not os.path.exists(init_path):
    print("bittensor __init__.py not found. Ensure bittensor is correctly installed.")
    return
```

This block checks if the `__init__.py` file for `bittensor` exists in its installation directory. If it doesn't, an error message is printed and the script stops executing.

### Remove nest_asyncio imports from bittensor __init__.py

```python
with open(init_path, 'r') as file:
    lines = file.readlines()

with open(init_path, 'w') as file:
    for line in lines:
        if 'nest_asyncio' not in line:
            file.write(line)
```

This block reads the contents of `bittensor/__init__.py`, removes any lines that contain `import nest_asciio`, and writes the updated content back to the file.

### Uninstall nest_asyncio

```python
os.system("pip uninstall -y nest_asyncio")
```

If `nest_asyncio` is detected as installed, this command uses the operating system's `os.system()` method to execute a pip command and remove the package.

## Usage

To use this script, simply run it with Python:

```bash
python remove_nest_asyncio_import.py
```

The script will attempt to locate the `bittensor` package, check its integrity, and remove any references to `nest_asciio` if present. Additionally, it will uninstall the `nest_asciio` package if found.
