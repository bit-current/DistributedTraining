 # Documentation for Version Nomenclature and Compatibility Logic

## Introduction
This documentation explains the logic behind the version nomenclature and compatibility checks implemented in the following Python code.

## Code Snippet
```python
# For backward compatibility with Auto-Update

# The MIT License (MIT)
# ...

__version__ = "0.0.30"

version_split = __version__.split(".")
__spec_version__ = (100 * int(version_split[0])) + (10 * int(version_split[1])) + (1 * int(version_split[2]))
```
## Version Nomenclature
The version number in the `__version__` variable follows the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH nomenclature, where:
- MAJOR is incremented when making backwards-incompatible changes (e.g., changing an API).
- MINOR is incremented when adding new features or improvements that maintain backwards compatibility with previous versions.
- PATCH is incremented for bug fixes and minor changes that do not impact the API.

## Version Specification
The `__spec_version__` variable represents a more precise version number derived from the MAJOR, MINOR, and PATCH components of the `__version__`. It's calculated as:
```makefile
spec_version = 100 * major + 10 * minor + patch
```
This version specification is used for more precise dependency management.

## Backward Compatibility and Auto-Update
The commented line `# For backward compatibility with Auto-Update` indicates that this code was added to maintain backward compatibility when using an auto-update mechanism that may not fully respect the semantic versioning rules. The code converts the `__version__` string to a more precise `__spec_version__` value, allowing for more precise dependency management and ensuring compatibility between different versions of the library.
