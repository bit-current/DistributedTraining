    long_description_content_type='text/markdown',
    url='https://github.com/yourgithubusername/your_project_repo',
    # Package contents and dependencies
    packages=find_packages(),
    include_package_data=True,
    install_requires=open('requirements.txt').read().splitlines(),
    classifiers=[
        'Programming Language :: Python :: 3',
        'License :: OSI Approved :: MIT License',
        'Operating System :: OS Independent',
    ],
